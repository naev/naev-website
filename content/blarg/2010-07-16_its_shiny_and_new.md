I’ve griped numerous times that between releases, NAEV is a very quiet project.

The vast majority of our discussions occur on [our IRC channel](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=naev), which typically has around 30 users. Each of our releases sees thousands of downloads, yet even the mailing list has less than a hundred subscribers.

That is to say, our discussions never reach more than 5% of our user base, and that’s being *very* generous.

So, in the hope of alleviating that and keeping interest in the project between releases, we’re going to be posting status updates here. Hopefully it’ll also provide a good venue for questions and answers, for the less IRC-inclined.
