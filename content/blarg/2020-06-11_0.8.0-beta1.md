With 3 years since the last release we are happy to announce the first (and
likely last with no hiccups) of version 0.8.0. This version contains a ton of
fixes and new contents, including major gameplay mechanic changes. We don't
anticipate too many issues with this beta, but if you try it and find any
issues, please report them at [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues). Discussion about the game can
also be had on IRC (#naev on irc.freenode.net) or Discord ([discord
invite](https://discord.com/invite/nd2M5BR)).
