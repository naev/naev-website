This is a maintenance patch that fixes a lot of small issues here and there. It
includes improvements on deployed escorts, fixing looting FLF ships causing
nearby planets and other ships to become hostile, and puts Dvaered ships for
sale among other things.

You can get the latest version from any of the following sources:

<%= badge( "github", "0.12.2" ) %>
<%= badge( "steam" ) %>
<%= badge( "itchio" ) %>
<%= badge( "flathub" ) %>

The new version should be compatible with older save games, and will update
things as necessary.
