Following the winter tradition, the Naev DevTeam is proud to announce the
release of version 0.11.0.
This is again quite a large release that has rewritten and reworked large parts
of the engine and long-established mechanics to be more flexible, faster, and
efficient.
Many long-term players will notice that many things they had gotten used to
have been changed, starting from the Naev universe itself.

We would like to thank all the contributors who have participated and helped in
the making of this release.

Most notable changes:

* Reworked universe map to fit existing lore
* House Sirius completely reworked
* Improved autonav that uses lanes and is configurable
* Reworked structural outfits and number of ship slots
* Weapon sets are more simple with no distinction between weapons and non-weapons
* Possible to legally obtain all "standard" factional ships and outfits
* Point defense weapons that automatically fire at fighters and missiles
* A lot more content
* Significant engine speed-ups

You can get the latest version from any of the following sources:

<%= badge( "github", "0.11.0" ) %>
<%= badge( "steam" ) %>
<%= badge( "itchio" ) %>
<%= badge( "flathub" ) %>

The new version should be compatible with older save games, and will update
things as necessary. However, in this release, given the big changes done to
the universe, old saves will potentially have the their universe map in a bit
of a mess.
