After a longer than expected hiatus, the Naev website is back! It has been completely redone and is also hosted on [github](https://github.com/naev/naev-website).

While development has slowed down, it has not completely stalled. Besides many different bug fixes and code tweaks, some new missions have been added.

Furthermore, although the IRC channel (#naev on irc.freenode.net) still exists, we have also created a discord for the Naev project. You can join it with this [discord invite](https://discord.com/invite/nd2M5BR). 

Hopefully 2020 will bring more developments in the Naev project. Happy new year to all!
