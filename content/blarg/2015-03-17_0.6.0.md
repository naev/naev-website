The Naev development team is proud to announce the release of Naev 0.6.0, our first stable release in nearly three years.

This release features over 1600 commits from some 38 contributors, as well as small fixes from many more. Its main features are the core slots system, which allows ships to be more heavily customized, as well as full SDL2 support, which greatly improves Naev’s fullscreen behaviour among other things.
