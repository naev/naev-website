After lots of nagging and harassing of developers we finally have it! The great epic new fancy main menu background, and what could be fancier than naev itself? Yes the background is a system (specifically it’s the start system for now). It’ll be a bit fancier in the future but you can now enjoy the awesomeness. No more boring backgrounds! Check it out!
