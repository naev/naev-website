As part of our move to become more independent from Google’s services, which should allow us more flexibility and comfort, we have decided to host [our own](https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki) wiki. This wiki will allow us to organize proposals, todo and overall design considerations by centralizing them. This does not make either the forums or the mailing list obsolete, but complements them. It’s not fully fleshed out yet, but it is already far superior to the old one. If you are interested in Naev and would like to contribute to [the wiki](https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki), feel free.

One decision we have taken on [the wiki](https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki) is that we do not want every planet to have it’s own article. The wiki should focus on general information for both developers and players, without recording individual details. So, while the [Empire faction](https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki/The-Empire) gets it’s own page, the planet Em 5 does not. As with all wikis, we ask that you please do not add stuff you would like to see in game directly without getting the approval of a devteam member. However, you are completely free to write a proposal and submit that for review. You are all welcome to use [the Naev wiki](https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki), let the editing begin!
