blurb: Naev 0.12.0-beta.1 is released!
---

This year, we're starting the betas a bit early given the large amount of
content modified and added. As always, this release contains a large amount of
changes done during the past year which likely have introduced a lot of bugs
and issues that we want to iron out before the final release of 0.12.0.

Now, this release changes a lot of how the game currently plays, and, while it
is highly recommended to start a new game, it should be possible to just load
up your old saves without too much stuff being changed. In particular, some of
the major changes are:

1. Nearly all the ships are now modeled in 3D with fancy lighting and tilting effects!
2. You can now capture ships!
3. New ships and ship variants!
4. Faction reputation is no longer a single global value, but more nuanced and local.
5. New challenging area to access many secrets.
6. In-game Wiki full of mechanics and lore explanations!

If you try it and find any issues, please report them at [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues). Discussion about the game can be
had on one of the various discussion forums and chatrooms we have. Check them
out [here!](https://naev.org/contact/)
