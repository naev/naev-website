blurb: The Naev DevTeam announces the release of Naev version 0.12.3
---

This is the third maintenance patch of the 0.12.0 release, that fixes a bunch
of minor issues. Some of the larger fixes include not being able to stealth
with active point defense, and distress signals causing hostility cascades
which could be a problem especially in the Frontier. We don't anticipate too
many more problems and have shifted most of the focus on development of the
next major release.

You can get the latest version from any of the following sources:

<%= badge( "github", "0.12.3" ) %>
<%= badge( "steam" ) %>
<%= badge( "itchio" ) %>
<%= badge( "flathub" ) %>

The new version should be compatible with older save games, and will update
things as necessary.
