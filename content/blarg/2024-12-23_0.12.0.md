After a whole month of beta testing and furious bug fixing, following the
tradition, we are once again doing our yearly release. This release includes
many significant engine improvements, such as 3D ships,an in-game wiki,
reworked weapon sets, significant speed increases, etc., but also significant
content including a whole new area, more and rework missions, and ship variant
among others. We also have not forgotten significant quality of life with
folding messages, more indicators, filtering for the mission computer, and
more!

We would like to thank all the contributors who participated and helped in the
making of this release that we hope will both surprise new players and veterans
alike!

Most notable changes:

* Nearly all the ships are now modeled in 3D with fancy lighting and tilting effects!
* You can now capture ships!
* New ships and ship variants!
* Faction reputation is no longer a single global value, but more nuanced and local.
* Simplified and more powerful weapon sets
* New challenging area to access many secrets.
* In-game Wiki full of mechanics and lore explanations!
