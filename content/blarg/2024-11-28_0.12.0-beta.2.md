blurb: Naev 0.12.0-beta.2 is released!
---

A lot of major and minor issues, in addition to some minor new features, have
been resolved calling for a 0.12.0-beta.2. In particular, support for lowering
the saturation of the nebula, and having escorts respect your autonav
preferences (you can disable it in the settings from the info menu) have been
added as new features. We don't have any intention of adding any new features
before the final 0.12.0 version, and will keep on resolving bugs as they are
found.
As always, please report any issues on [this tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues),
and feel free to join our Discord or Matrix chatrooms. Find out more about them [here!](https://naev.org/contact/)
