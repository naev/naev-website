title: Naev 0.8.0-beta.4

tags: [ 'release' ]

It so happens that instead of having things cool down and prepare for the
release, development has instead accelerated with 1473 commits from the
previous beta. For this reason, we are going to do a final beta for 0.8.0,
aiming to release full 0.8.0 by the end of this year. We would like to say that
we don't anticipate too many issues with this beta, but given the amount of
code changed anything can happen. For this reason, please try it and find any
issues, please report them at [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues). Discussion about the game can
also be had on Discord ([discord invite](https://discord.com/invite/nd2M5BR)).
