We are proud to announce the 0.8.1 release of Naev. This fixes some important
issues found in 0.8.0. Due to popular demand, time constant (previously known
as time dilation) has been reduced significantly.  We don't expect there to be
many remaining issues, but if you do find any, please report them at [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues). Discussion about the game can
also be had on Discord ([discord invite](https://discord.com/invite/nd2M5BR)).

You can get the latest version from any of the following three sources:

* [Naev on github](https://github.com/naev/naev/releases/tag/v0.8.1)
* [Naev on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/598530/Naev/)
* [Naev on itch.io](https://naev.itch.io/naev)

Changelog:

* Gameplay
   * Lowered large ships' time constant (renamed from time dilation) by 50% of the deviation from 100%.
   * Tweaked Za'lek ships' stats and outfit slot behavior to match expectations.
* Engine
   * Restored macOS support. (Catalina users will have to bypass Gatekeeper: See https://github.com/naev/naev/wiki/FAQ for details.)
   * Fixed a crash-loop when the "saves" folder gets populated by Steam data (or other files) and no Naev save files.
   * Fixed intermittent error messages about the "Lua Spawn script for faction 'Trader'".
   * Fixed rare/potential bugs in font and save-file code.
   * Fixed crash when navigating landing screens with the tab key.
   * Updated German translation.
   * Improved text in minor ways.
