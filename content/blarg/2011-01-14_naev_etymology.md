Today we’ll talk about the name of this game: it’s history, pronunciation and how to write it. First off a bit of history, as you probably do know, NAEV originally stood for “*Neutron Accelerated Extreme Velocity*” although “*Not Another Escape Velocity*” was also widely accepted. The original idea was to sort of create an improved clone of the [original Escape Velocity game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_Velocity_%28video_game%29). However with the 0.5.0 release we will transcend that. Naev is no longer a clone and therefore no longer an acronym, it is now a proper noun. So from now on no more NAEV, only Naev! You may notice I have been changing that, this unification of criteria will make it easier to handle and no longer cause confusion.

Now onto pronunciation, how is it pronounced? In case someday we hold a Naev meet or the likes we should all know how to pronounce it so we don’t make a mess and fools of ourselves (we probably will anyway). The proper way to pronounce Naev is **/nɑ.ɛv/** if I got right my symbols (would need confirmation). I know most of you pronounce it more like knave, but trust me, that is wrong.

For those who still have doubts on how to pronounce: Naev Pronounciation

**Naev /nɑ.ɛv/** An open source action/RPG space video game.

**NOTE** Unfortunately it looks like we will have to rely on phonetic spelling due to a missing sound clip.
