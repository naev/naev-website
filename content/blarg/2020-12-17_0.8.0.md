We are proud to present the 0.8.0 release of Naev! This has over 4,000 commits
from 0.7.0 and has been under development for the past 3.5 years. The backend
and interface has been revamped to be modern with lots of improvements all over
the board. Some examples include unicode and internationalization support. We
would like to thank all the contributors who have participated in this release.

Some of the more notable gameplay changes include making missiles and fighter
bays not require ammunition, changed how some pilots spawn, time passes faster
in larger ships, and a revamped commodity/economy system.

We don't expect there to be many issues, but if you do find any, please report
them at [the issue tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues). Discussion
about the game can also be had on Discord ([discord
invite](https://discord.com/invite/nd2M5BR)).
