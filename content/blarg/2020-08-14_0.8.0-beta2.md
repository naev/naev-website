Given significant changes since 0.8.0-beta1 we have decided to do another beta
before the final release (last one hopefully.) We don't anticipate too many
issues with this beta, but if you try it and find any issues, please report
them at [the issue tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues). Discussion
about the game can also be had on IRC (#naev on irc.freenode.net) or Discord
([discord invite](https://discord.com/invite/nd2M5BR)).

[Download the new version from here](https://github.com/naev/naev/releases/tag/v0.8.0-beta.2).
