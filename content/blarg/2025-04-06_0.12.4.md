blurb: The Naev DevTeam announces the release of Naev version 0.12.4
---

This is the fourth maintenance patch of the 0.12.0 release. It contains fixes
for several crashes, including a fairly high impact one when shooting asteroids
with explosive weapons. It also ensures that no pirate presence leaks into
the area around the starting system, and makes sure some missions are
completable. This release looks set to be the final of the 0.12.x series as we
focus on the 0.13.0 release that is slated for December this year.

You can get the latest version from any of the following sources:

<%= badge( "github", "0.12.4" ) %>
<%= badge( "steam" ) %>
<%= badge( "itchio" ) %>
<%= badge( "flathub" ) %>

The new version should be compatible with older save games, and will update
things as necessary.
