We are proud to release Naev 0.7.0, which will also be the first release included on Steam (thanks again for the Greenlight and sorry for the delay!). This version includes new missions and a swathe of improvements and fixes overall and contains patches from 25 different contributors.

At the current time, we are not providing Mac OS binaries, but when someone gets around to that will we include those too.
