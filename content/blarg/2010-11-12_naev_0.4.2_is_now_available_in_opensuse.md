While development continues towards 0.5.0, increased availability of the current stable release is always a good thing. NAEV can now be found in the openSUSE Games repository.

See [here](https://software.opensuse.org/search?q=naev&baseproject=openSUSE%3A11.3&lang=en&exclude_filter=home%3A&exclude_debug=true) for downloadable packages for openSUSE 11.3. There are also packages built for a number of other RPM-based distributions, including Mandriva and Fedora listed by the [build service](https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/games/naev), downloadable from [here](https://software.opensuse.org/search?q=naev&baseproject=ALL&lang=en&exclude_filter=home%3A&exclude_debug=true). It appears that you’ll need the naev and naev-data packages; after installing both, NAEV should be ready to play.
