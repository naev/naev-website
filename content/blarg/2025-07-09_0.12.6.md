blurb: The Naev DevTeam announces the release of Naev version 0.12.6
---

This is a minor hotfix that mainly addresses an issue with 0.12.5 that broke
point defense weapons for the player. If all goes well, this should be the last
0.12.x release.

You can get the latest version from any of the following sources:

<%= badge( "github", "0.12.6" ) %>
<%= badge( "steam" ) %>
<%= badge( "itchio" ) %>
<%= badge( "flathub" ) %>

The new version should be compatible with older save games, and will update
things as necessary.

* Dvaered Negotiation 1: update the location of the target on the map
* Dvaered Sabotage: no longer fail the mission if the target jumps out after boarding
* Fixed point defense turning off all the time
* Minor typo fixes and translation updates
