The Naev DevTeam is satisfied to announce the release of Naev version 0.9.3. This
release addresses issues and bugs from the 0.9.2 release and does not add
any new content. It is highly recommended to update from 0.9.2 as soon as possible. In particular, two fairly important bugs involving game hanging sometimes when entering certain nebula systems and crashes have been fixed.

Although it has been heavily tested, there are almost certainly still bugs
around, please report any issues on [this
tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues), and feel free to join our
Discord or Matrix ([chat rooms](https://naev.org/contact/)).
