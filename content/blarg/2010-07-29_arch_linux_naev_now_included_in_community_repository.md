The packages ([naev and naev-data](https://archlinux.org/packages/?q=naev)) are still quite new, so some mirrors may not have synced yet.

Special thanks to cleanrock, who created and maintained the Arch User Repository PKGBUILD, and to those who voted for NAEV’s inclusion in the official repositories, without which we’d likely not be packaged.
