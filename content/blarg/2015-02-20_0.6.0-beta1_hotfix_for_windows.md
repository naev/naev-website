We’ve just released updated Windows installers to remedy save corruption and a related crash.

Simply download and re-run the installer. It’s fine to run over top of the existing install, and you do not need to re-download ndata.

[Windows (32-bit)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/naev/files/naev-0.6.0/naev-0.6.0-beta1-win32.exe/download)
[Windows (64-bit)](https://sourceforge.net/projects/naev/files/naev-0.6.0/naev-0.6.0-beta1-win64.exe/download)

The issue affects all versions of Windows, as long as save compression is enabled (which is the default). You may also want to delete all backup saves, located in %APPDATA\naev\saves\ with the extension .ns.backup, though this isn’t required.
