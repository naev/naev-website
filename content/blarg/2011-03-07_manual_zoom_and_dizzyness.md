title: Manual Zoom and Dizzyness

It has come to my attention that numerous people become dizzy while playing Naev. As it is to my interest that no physical discomfort happen while playing Naev I’ve dealt with probably the first cause which is the zoom. While the zoom is nice to have automatic (and you can tweak it’s behaviour), it seems like it can make people dizzy. So Naev now has an option to enable manual zoom. It is controlled by mouse wheel, however I’ll probably add key bindings in the near future.

<figure style="text-align:center;">
 <div class="embed-responsive figure-img">
    <img class='img-fluid' alt='Screenshot' src="<%= @items['/imgs/blarg/2011/03/screenshot001-300x249.png'].path %>" />
 </div>
 <figcaption class="figure-caption">Location of the checkbox to enable manual zoom.</figcaption>
</figure>

This is a start. If anybody experiences dizziness still with Naev 0.5.0 I’d be very interested in feedback and investigation into what exactly triggers it to try to solve the issue.
