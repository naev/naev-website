After a long road, Naev 0.7.0 is now [available on steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/598530/Naev/)! At the current time Windows and Linux (64 bits) are supported.

We note that Naev will still remain an open source project, and no steam-specific changes have been done, i.e., Naev on steam is the same as on github. Finally, Naev will remain free on the steam store and updated with releases.
