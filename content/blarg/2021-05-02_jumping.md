*This post is about development on Naev 0.9.0.*

Given that the old jump animation was a bit bland, fading in and out from
white, we decided to give it a new spin with GLSL shaders. Furthermore, it is
now possible to use multiple different jump animations. Currently only two are
used in-game, but this might be extended in the future.
