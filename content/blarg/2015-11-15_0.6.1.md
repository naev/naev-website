It’s been a while, but we’re proud to announce Naev 0.6.1. This is a minor release that has a slew of fixes, improvements and missions. It fixes some important issues that cropped up in the previous release and thus we highly encourage everyone to update to 0.6.1.

This release would have not been possible without the help of both [onpon4](https://github.com/onpon4), [nenau](https://github.com/nenau), and [Ian D. Scott](https://github.com/ids1024) who have been very active of late. We would like to once again thank all contributors for making this release possible.
