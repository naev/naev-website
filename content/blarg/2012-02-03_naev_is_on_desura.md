~~I suppose I should qualify that with an almost.~~ Thanks to the efforts of #naev IRC regular oldtopman, we’re all set up ~~and awaiting final approval~~. ~~Once we go live,~~ Naev ~~will be~~ *is* available via Desura on all of our usual supported platforms (32 and 64-bit Linux, Windows and Mac OS X). The Desura client is presently exclusive to Windows and Linux, but Naev will still be downloadable on OS X through Desura’s site.

For those unaware of Desura, it’s a digital distribution platform. I’ll let Desura’s own [about page](https://web.archive.org/web/20120314232311/http://www.desura.com/about) do the rest of the talking.

Without further ado, here’s a link to Naev’s Desura page:

**Update:** As of now, Naev is live on Desura!
