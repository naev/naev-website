title: NAEV forum added.

To complement this blog, we’ve now added [a forum](https://web.archive.org/web/20100914210333/http://forum.naev.org/) to the site.

It’s somewhat bare at the moment, but it should provide a good venue for feedback, and it’s certainly a more familiar format for many users who aren’t used to mailing lists and IRC channels.

The observant NAEV players among you may have noticed that the blog and forum logos differ from what’s in-game (as of 0.4.2). That’s thanks to Scaatis, and there’s a forum thread on the art he’s contributed [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20100914210333/http://forum.naev.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&p=17). Typographical geeks may notice that the new logo is in fact an [ambigram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambigram).

In time we’ll also roll out a proper (non-Google Code) Wiki here on naev.org and integrate it with the forum.
