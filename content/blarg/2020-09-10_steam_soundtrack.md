We have added support for the latest beta and nightly automated builds on
Steam. You can opt-in by right-clicking in the library and selecting the branch
you want from the opt-in beta. The generation of these branches is all
automated and there are no differences with using the downloads available on
[github](https://github.com/naev/naev/releases).

We have also added support to generate a soundtrack using all 54 tracks from
the game. This can be created by using the `make soundtrack` command from the
source code. This has also been added to steam, and we are working to make this
available on other sites such as soundcloud.
