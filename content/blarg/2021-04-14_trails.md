title: Trails for EVERYTHING!
tags: [ 'development' ]

*This post is about development on Naev 0.9.0.*

By moving to newer versions of OpenGL in version 0.8, we have modernized the
rendering pipeline of Naev, however, we have not been making full use of that
power. Well, at least not up until now. We are proud to present trails for
ships and missiles! These are generated procedurally using GLSL shaders, and are
capable of having complex animations. There are currently a total of 7
different trails depending on the ship and missile, ranging from cool, to very
cool.
