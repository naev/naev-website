The Naev development team is proud to announce the release of Naev 0.5.2. This is mainly a bugfix release, though it also introduces a small amount of content in the form of missions and outfits.

The new asset discovery mechanics have bothered quite a few people, so we’ve introduced a jump scanner outfit that greatly increases jump detection range, as well as local maps which behave similarly to the traditional star maps found in 0.5.0 and earlier releases.

Now, as per usual it’s time for some statistics, from 0.5.1 to 0.5.2:

83 files changed, 2408 insertions(+), 574 deletions(-)

More than half of the added lines come from the dat/ directory tree, thanks in large part to a new event and a repeatable mission for the Sirius faction.
