blurb: The Naev DevTeam announces the release of Naev version 0.12.1
---

With big releases, come big bugs. A bug that would potentially mark the entire
player's map as known has crept into the release. It has been fixed along with
other minor fixes, in particular, a bug made the obelisk tests require
manual setting of weapon sets, and a persistent ship AI repeating to the player
over and over that they haven't played in a while.

You can get the latest version from any of the following sources:

<%= badge( "github", "0.12.1" ) %>
<%= badge( "steam" ) %>
<%= badge( "itchio" ) %>
<%= badge( "flathub" ) %>

The new version should be compatible with older save games, and will update
things as necessary.
