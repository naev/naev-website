title: 'Naev 0.11.0-beta.1'

It's nearing the end of the year and that means time for a new Naev release!
This release is once again a ig one that revamps a lot of existing features and
legacy code, while adding lots of new content and features. Like always,
instead of doing a release directly, we're going to be doing a series of betas
to try to ensure as few bugs as possible sneak into the final release. We plan
to do the official release in about two weeks from now, but it will depend on
how many issues and the likes are found.

Now, this release changes a lot of how the game currently playe, and, while it
is highly recommended to start a new game, it should be possible to just load
up your old saves without too much stuff being changed. In particular, some of
the major changes are:

1. Significantly reworked universe map to fit existing lore
2. House Sirius completely reworked
3. Significantly improved autonav that uses lanes and is configurable
4. Reworked structural outfits and number of ship slots
5. Weapon sets are more simple with no distinction between weapons and non-weapons
6. Possible to legally obtain all "standard" factional ships and outfits

If you try it and find any issues, please report them at [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues). Discussion about the game can be
had on one of the various discussion forums and chatrooms we have. Check them
out [here!](https://naev.org/contact/)
