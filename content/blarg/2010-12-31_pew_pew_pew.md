Lots of you have complained about accuracy in Naev and hitting stuff with forward mounts. As part of the increased range and weapon rants it was unbearable in the sense you never hit anything unless you went point blank. I am proud to announce the implementation of swivel forward mounts. That means all weapons have a tendency to correct minor errors in accuracy. The longer the range generally the more they compensate. This also works similar to turrets with electronic warfare, but generally the accuracy is much higher with forward mounts than with turrets. Hopefully this will make forward mounted weapons actually usable.

You can check out the changes in the every unstable balance branch on github.
