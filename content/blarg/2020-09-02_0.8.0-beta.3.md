title: Naev 0.8.0-beta.3
author: bobbens
tags: [ 'release' ]

Since a lot of fairly important stuff in the engine has changed, we have
decided to do yet another beta. From this release on we have also moved to
[semver](https://semver.org/) version notation. For this reason all the version
tags on [github](https://github.com/naev/naev/) have been regenerated. We don't
anticipate many issues from now on and expect to release the full version of
0.8.0 shortly.  We don't anticipate too many issues with this beta, but if you
try it and find any issues, please report them at [the issue
tracker](https://github.com/naev/naev/issues). Discussion about the game can
also be had on IRC (#naev on irc.freenode.net) or Discord ([discord
invite](https://discord.com/invite/nd2M5BR)).

[Download the new version from here](https://github.com/naev/naev/releases/tag/v0.8.0-beta.3).
