*This post is about development on Naev 0.9.0.*

![LÖVE Logo](<%= @items['/imgs/blarg/love2d.png'].path %>).

*Disclaimer: the LÖVE project has nothing to do with Naev. We just thought
their API was cool and decided to implement it.*

As you may know, the Naev scripting engine is written in Lua. Since the
original releases of Naev, the Lua ecosystem has seen an incredible growth,
being using in notable games and software. One of these great frameworks is
[LÖVE](https://love2d.org/), which is a 2D game API. While we haven't rewritten
Naev in LÖVE, what we have done is implement a subset of the LÖVE API in Naev.
In combination with the dialogue systems we had already implemented in Naev, we
were able to extend it such that LÖVE games could be launched inside of Naev
using the Naev engine. Since a picture says a thousand words, let us see some
examples taken from
[simplegametutorials](https://simplegametutorials.github.io/love/).

We can see the game is being run inside a dialogue window inside of Naev. Mouse
input is passed and it reacts to user input.

An independent game loop can also be run inside of Naev, along with keyboard
input to create a snake game.

Of course what game is complete without a Sokoban minigame?

Since Naev itself has asteroids, it seems like the next logical steps is to run
an asteroids clone inside of Naev.

Although we haven't shown any original mini-games. The LÖVE API has a nearly
infinite potential for creation. In future posts we will show some of the
different ways it is being used in Naev.
